## üì¶ Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Foji requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to be installed on your system. Make sure you have it installed before proceeding.

To install Foji, run the following command:

```bash
npm i foji -g
```

## üö¶ Usage

Foji stores your commands and configurations in its configuration file (`~/.config/foji.json`). You can access it using:

```bash
foji config
```

Or open it directly:

```bash
foji config -f
```

### Running a Command

To execute a saved `command`:

```bash
foji [command name] [...command args]
```

> [!TIP]
> If you don‚Äôt provide a valid command name, Foji will list all available commands, including default commands like `add`, `remove`, and `sync`, along with any custom commands you've added.

### Skipping an Argument

If you want to skip an optional argument, use the `_` symbol:

```bash
foji [command name] [arg1] _ [arg3]
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Management

Foji allows you to easily create and update your command configurations.

### Adding a New Command

To add a new command to the configuration:

```bash
foji add [command name] [command]
```

Supported argument types:

1. **Required Arguments**:  
   These arguments **must** be provided for the command to run.

   ```json
   "command": "echo <requiredArgumentOne> <requiredArgumentTwo>"
   ```

2. **Optional Arguments**:  
   These arguments **are not mandatory**. If not provided, they will be skipped.

   ```json
   "command": "echo <requiredArgumentOne> <optionalArgumentOne?>"
   ```

3. **Optional Arguments with Default Values**:  
   If not provided, a default value will be used.

   ```json
   "command": "echo <requiredArgumentOne> <optionalArgumentOne ?? My Default Value>"
   ```

4. **Ternary Arguments**:  
   Works as a boolean argument, only checking whether it was passed.

   ```json
   "command": "echo i want pizza of <requiredArgumentOne> with <hasCheese ? cheese : no cheese>"
   ```

5. **Spread Argument**:  
   Catches all the remaining arguments.

   ```json
   "command": "echo [<argOne>] {<argTwo...>}"
   ```

Example of usage:

```bash
foji command "my arg one" one two three --my --options
```

The resulting final command would be:

```bash
echo [my arg one] {one two three --my --options}
```

> [!IMPORTANT] > **Always** provide required arguments **before** any optional ones.

### Removing a Command

To remove a command:

```bash
foji remove [command name]
```

## üåê Cloud Sync

You can easily sync your configurations using cloud services.

> [!NOTE]
> Foji uses [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to create, read and update your configuration gist.

### Upload Configuration

To upload your configuration to a gist (or create a new gist if one doesn‚Äôt exist):

```bash
foji upload
```

### Download Configuration

To download a configuration file from a gist:

```bash
foji download [gist url]
```

### Sync Configuration

To sync your local configuration with its URL:

```bash
foji sync
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Be careful when syncing from external sources. Always verify the origin of the gist to avoid overriding your custom commands.
