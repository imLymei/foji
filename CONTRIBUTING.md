# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the project! We're glad you're here and interested in contributing. Before you get started, please take a moment to review the following guidelines to help make the contribution process smooth and effective for everyone.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository:** Click on the "Fork" button on the top right corner of the repository's page, then clone your fork locally.

2. **Create a new branch:** Make your changes in a new branch created from the `main` branch. Choose a descriptive name for your branch related to the issue or feature you're working on.

3. **Make your changes:** Implement the changes or additions you'd like to contribute. Please follow any existing coding style and conventions.

4. **Test your changes:** Ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality. If you're adding new features, include tests to cover your code.

5. **Commit your changes:** Make meaningful and atomic commits. Please provide a clear and descriptive commit message for each commit.

6. **Push your changes:** Once your changes are ready, push your branch to your fork of the repository.

7. **Create a Pull Request (PR):** Go back to the original repository and navigate to the Pull Requests tab. Click on "New Pull Request" and choose your branch as the compare branch. Fill out the PR template with relevant information and details about your changes.

8. **Review and address feedback:** Be open to feedback and iterate on your changes if necessary. Respond promptly to any comments or requests for changes from the maintainers.

9. **Merge your PR:** Once your PR has been approved and all checks have passed, a maintainer will merge your changes into the main branch. Congratulations on your contribution!
